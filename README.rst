A simple, deterministic, and extensible approach to 
`inverse text normalization <https://www.google.com/search?q=inverse+text+normalization>`_ 
(ITN) for numbers.

Overview
--------

This package converts raw spoken-form text (speech recognition output) into 
user-friendly written-form text. It works best for converting spoken numbers 
into numerical digits, or other translation tasks that do not modify word ordering. 
A `csv <https://github.com/barseghyanartur/itnpy/blob/master/assets/vocab.csv>`_ 
file is provided to define the basic rules for transforming spoken tokens into 
written tokens, and extra pre/post-processing may be applied for more specific 
formatting requirements, i.e. dates, measurements, money, etc.
